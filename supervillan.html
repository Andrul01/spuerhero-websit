            <p><img src="E:\HTML\CSS\Spider-Man-No-Way-Home-03.webp"style="float: right;width:300px;height:200px;"></p>
   
            <h2 style="font-size:30px;">1. Norman Osborn / Green Goblin</h2>
            <p><strong style="font-size:20px">Played by:</strong> Willem Dafoe</p>
            <p><strong style="font-size:20px">First appearance:</strong>“Spider-Man” (2002) </p>
            <p><strong style="font-size:20px">Most recent appearance:</strong> “Spider-Man: No Way Home” (2021)</p>
            <p>In “Spider-Man,” Norman transforms from Peter Parker’s mentor — and the father of his best friend — to a power-crazed, homicidal mad man so indelibly terrifying that he haunts Spidey’s life well after his death in the first film. Dafoe had to audition for the part, which seems ludicrous now, given how sublimely well-suited he is to the role; even in “No Way Home,” Osborn proves to be the most malevolent force in the life of every Peter Parker he encounters.</p>

             <h2 style="font-size:30px;">2. Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus</h2>
   
             <p><img src="E:\HTML\CSS\Alfred-Molina-Doctor-Octopus-Spiderman.webp"style="float: right;width:300px;height:200px;"></p>
   
             <p><strong style="font-size:20px">Played by:</strong>Alfred Molina </p>
             <p><strong style="font-size:20px">First appearance:</strong>“Spider-Man 2” (2004)</p>
             <p><strong style="font-size:20px">Most recent appearance:</strong>“Spider-Man: No Way Home” (2021) </p>
             <p>Doc Ock’s powers — four giant robotic arms fused to his spine and overriding his sense of higher morality — are the peak of comic book eccentricity, which only makes the grounded, human poignancy Molina and director Sam Raimi bring to the character that much more impressive. He’s brilliant and brutal in equal measure.

                 <h3 style="font-size:30px;">3. N’Jadaka / Erik “Killmonger” Stevens </h3>
   
                 <p><img src="E:\HTML\CSS\black-panther-4.webp"style="float: right;width:300px;height:200px;"></p>
   
                 <p><strong style="font-size:20px">Played by:</strong> Michael B. Jordan</p>
                 <p><strong style="font-size:20px">First appearance:</strong>“Black Panther” (2018)</p>
                 <p><strong style="font-size:20px">Most recent appearance:</strong>“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” (2022)</p>
                 <p>The unwitting prodigal son of Wakanda’s royal family transformed himself into a lethal military assassin so he could meticulously manipulate his way onto the throne. Killmonger’s simmering rage — so vividly rendered by Jordan — ultimately consumes him, but it doesn’t negate the fact that he’s right: Wakanda should have been sharing its vast technological resources with the rest of the African diaspora, instead of withholding it in isolation. That’s a helluva arc for a Marvel villain.</p>

                 <h3 style="font-size:30px;">4. Thanos</h3>
   
                 <p><img src="E:\HTML\CSS\avengers-endgame.webp"style="float: right;width:300px;height:200px;"></p>
   
                 <p><strong style="font-size:20px">Played by:</strong>Josh Brolin</p>
                 <p><strong style="font-size:20px">First appearance:</strong>“The Avengers” (2012)</p>
                 <p><strong style="font-size:20px">Most recent appearance:</strong>“Avengers: Endgame” (2019)</p>
                 <p>Most Marvel villains fail. Thanos succeeds in erasing half of all life in the universe. For that reason alone, the eggplant-skinned Mad Titan would rank high, but Brolin’s understated, world-weary performance makes Thanos far more relatable than one would ever expect from someone who was willing to sacrifice his daughter Gamora in pursuit of his genocidal ambitions. It’s true, Thanos does ultimately fail, but his impact still resonates inside the MCU to today</p>
